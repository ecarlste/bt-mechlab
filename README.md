# BattleTech MechLab

The BattleTech MechLab is a T3 Stack app inspired by the MechLab in MW5: Mercenaries, intended to be used with the BattleTech table top miniatures game. You can build any BattleMech you like in a very similar way to how you build them in MW5 with drag and drop functionality.

I've always preferred to build mechs this way rather than the step by step process that exists in the BattleTech Tech Manual.

Currently the app is only intended to allow the building of BattleMechs. Eventually, it would be my intent to be able to build any type of mech or vehicle for BattleTech Total Warfare.

## What technology did we use?

Most, if not all, of the technologies used are the same technologies that are used by the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). We are not necessarily using the same versions as what the T3 Stack uses, although most tech is the same. If you want to learn about any of the tech used, reference the links provided in the list below.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev)
